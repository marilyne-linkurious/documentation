This is the user manual of {{lke}}.

The first two chapters titled Getting Started and Building Your First 
Graph Visualization will teach you the basics of using {{lke}}.

The following chapters are divided in themes.
They go through the features of {{lke}} and explain how to apply them 
to successfully visualize graphs.
It works both as a manual and a primer on graph visualization.

Just like our software, this guide assumes no prior knowledge of graph 
visualization techniques.
If you read it thoroughly, you will be able to find valuable connections 
and structural patterns in your data, to improve your graph database, 
and to communicate your findings efficiently.
