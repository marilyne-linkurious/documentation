Your visualization is getting too complex and you may want to remove 
from a visualization (i.e. hide) a few nodes or edges to make it easier 
to understand. 
Notice that hidden nodes an edges are not deleted from the database.

For example, in the picture bellow, three nodes are selected. 
Simply click on `Hide` to remove them from the visualization.

The three nodes are now removed from the visualization.

The Toggle Lasso option can be used to select the nodes we want to hide, 
we need to make sure the central node is not selected otherwise all the 
edges connected to this node will also be hidden.
