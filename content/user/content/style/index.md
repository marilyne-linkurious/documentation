In this chapter, we'll learn how to adjust the [size](/node-size), 
[color](/node-color), [captions](/captions) and text of nodes or edges.
These techniques will help you make your visualizations more meaningful.

A default style may be defined by the Administrator of {{lke}}, 
see Chapter Getting Started > Styles. 
Users can change the styles after creating or opening a visualization. 
Notice that the styles set in new visualizations are automatically 
re-applied to newly created visualizations. 
Users can reset styles at any time.
