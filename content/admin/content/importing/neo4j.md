# Importing data into Neo4j

Linkurious relies on Neo4j to store the data.
The data importation is thus not handled by our solution.
Many options exist to import data into Neo4j:

- There is a [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) plugin that lets you export any file compatible with Gephi to Neo4j ([list of compatible formats](https://gephi.org/users/supported-graph-formats/)).
- If you can handle a spreadsheet, you can easily [import CSV formatted data](https://neo4j.com/blog/importing-data-into-neo4j-the-spreadsheet-way/).
- For the more tech savvy, have a look at the [CSV batch Importer](https://github.com/jexp/batch-import)

or the [Talend connector](https://github.com/Zenika/talend-neo4j-connector).
