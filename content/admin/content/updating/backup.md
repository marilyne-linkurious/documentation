Follow these steps to perform a backup of your Linkurious data:
1. [Stop Linkurious](/stop)
2. Back-up of the `linkurious/data` folder.
3. [Back-up the user-data store](/store-backup)
4. [Start Linkurious](/start)

Please note that this procedure does not back-up your graph data,
but only your Linkurious configuration and user-data (visualizations, users, etc.).
