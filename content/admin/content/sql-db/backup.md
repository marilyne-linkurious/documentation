If you are using the SQLite database (by default),
you only need to follow the [standard Linkurious backup procedure](/update-procedure).

If you are using another database to store the Linkurious user-data, please refer to one of the following guides:
- MySQL: [mysqldump, a database backup program](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysqldump.html)
- Microsoft SQL Server: [backup and restore of SQL Server Databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/)
- MariaDB: [backup and restore overview](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/backup-and-restore-overview/)
