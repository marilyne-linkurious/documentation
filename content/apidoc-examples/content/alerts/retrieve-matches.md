Alerts can only be created while authenticated as an **admin** by using HTTP cookie authentication.

If we want to retrieve the matches generated by an alert, though,
we can use the `GET /api/:dataSource/alerts/:alertId/matches` API with the `alert.read` access-right.

{{editfile:retrievematches.js}}
